# Tour Agency

unfinished and no intention for completing it unless requested because it's an old project when i started learning MERN stack so i just wanted to test my skill

Built using NODE , EXPRESS , MONGODB , MONGOOSE AND REACT.

I HAVE ADDED THE AUTHENTICATION TO THE UI AND A PAGE WHERE ALL CRUD OPERATIONS COULD BE DONE (A NON RESPONSIVE UI JUST FOR BIG SCREENS)

you can avail all the required files using npm install in both the directories

create your own env file and reference your own atlas link and jwt secrets
